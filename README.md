Technical Challenge: Frontend Software Engineering

For this challenge, we expect you to develop an application that uses the Swapi.dev API and
deploys it at Vercel.
Your app must have the following:
- A view where the user can see a list of the characters returned by the API:
https://swapi.dev/
- The view must have pagination.
- A way to find characters such as filters or a search box.
- A view where the user can see the detail of a specific character.
Must have:
- Bootstrap or Tailwind for the UI.
- Server-side rendering for each view in the application.
- Reusable components with included documentation inside the code to explain the logic
of each component and how you make it reusable.
- Proper use of git. Please donÂ´t upload your project to GitHub with just one commit; we
want to see how you use GitHub and how you document each change in your code.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
